AirBnB: Boaton and Seattle

This repository contains an analysis of data from AirBnBs in both Boston and Seattle.

This project is completed under the guidance of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program.

This analysis aims to answer three main questions:

What are the main economic differences for AirBnB between Seattle and Boston?

What are the habits of AirBnB renters for the two cities?

Are there correlations between the two above questions?

With a bonus question: Is the west coast really the best coast...for AirBnb?
